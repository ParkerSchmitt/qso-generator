The point of this program is to generate random QSOs given a partial alphabet,
as would be useful when learning morse code with the Koch method.

Using functions from this program, we can generate random callsigns; word-level
similar texts; letter-level similar texts; texts that resemble the original,
but are created with a subset of the original alphabet; and random QSOs given a
partial alphabets.

This is my first Lisp program, so expect it to be horrible. I'd love to learn
the idioms of the language better. I had a lot a lot of fun learning Lisp so
far.
